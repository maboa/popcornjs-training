		<h1>How would you like your Popcorn?</h1>
		<p><strong>Popcorn.js</strong> is a JavaScript Library that allows you to attach actions to time points in audio and video. It helps make media more web-like.</p>
		<p><strong>Popcorn Maker</strong> is powered by Popcorn.js and is a visual video editing tool which makes up part the Mozilla Foundation's Webmaker initiative.</p>
		<p>We're going to concentrate on Popcorn.js in this course, but first a brief lowdown on the wider Popcorn thing.</p>
		<p>Popcorn Maker is the second major iteration of creating a web-based video editing tool for the masses. The first was called <a href="http://popcornjs.org/butter-player">Butter Player</a>. However <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/butter/">Butter</a> is actually an SDK for authoring Popcorn projects.</p>
		<p>Popcorn Maker is a great tool, it's simple and powerful and newer versions are focussing on sequencing or remixing from various sources. Popcorn Maker is built with Popcorn.js and so allows the Popcorn Team to test out the core library and identify needs and weaknesses.</p>
		<p>So to sum up ...
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn.js</strong> is the JavaScript library used chiefly by developers.
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn Maker</strong> is a visual editor that uses Popcorn.js at its core and is used by anyone.
				<li>
					<strong>Butter Player</strong> is the prequel to Popcorn Maker - now largely defunct.
				<li>
					<strong>Butter</strong> is an SDK for authoring Popcorn projects.
			</ul>
