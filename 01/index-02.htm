			<em><strong>Popcorn folklore and legend :</strong> There used to be a web-based Popcorn builder where you could specify the plugins you wanted to include and it would build a special version just for you. Apparently now you can build your own using <a href="https://github.com/cadecairos/JS-Builder">https://github.com/cadecairos/JS-Builder</a>. You'll need to deploy a copy of it yourself on Heroku though.</em>
