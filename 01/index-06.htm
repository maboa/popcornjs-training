		<h1>Let's Code!</h1>

		<p>Popcorn functionality can be accessed entirely from JavaScript or it can enhance HTML content.</p>

		<p>Let's try the latter and as a precursor, embed video in our page.</p>

		<h2>Example:</h2>

		<script src="https://gist.github.com/maboa/5362181.js"></script>

		<p><strong>Note 1 : </strong> the use of types - used to explicitly tell the browser the file format. You can probably get away with not using these and actually you can be more detailed but I think this is a happy medium.</p>

		<p><strong>Note 2 : </strong> the controls attribute, which adds controls to the player, otherwise how would we play it? Yup, with JavaScript - that's right, but that's another story.</p>

		<h2>Action!</h2>

		<p>OK with this example in mind create a video player using HTML.</p>
		<p>You can use:
			<ul>
				<li>http://jPlayer.org/video/m4v/Big_Buck_Bunny_Trailer.m4v</li>
				<li>http://jPlayer.org/video/webm/Big_Buck_Bunny_Trailer.webm</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Feel free to use your own resources.</p>
