		<h1>Popcorn.js Browser Compatibility</h1>
		<p>Without fallbacks Popcorn.js relies on native audio/video support.</p>

		<p>Which is basically this.</p>
	
		<h2>Flavours of Popcorn.js (1.3)</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn Core (popcorn.min.js)</strong> is the core library - (7.2 kB zipped)
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn Complete (popcorn.complete.min.js)</strong> is popcorn.js plus most supported plugins - (86.3 kB zipped)
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn IE8 (popcorn-ie8.js)</strong> is a fallback which you need in addition to popcorn core to ensure IE8 compatibility - (10.1 kB zipped)
			</ul>
			Note non-minified versions are available for debug purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em><strong>Popcorn folklore and legend :</strong> There used to be a web-based Popcorn builder, where you could specify the plugins you wanted to include and it would build a special version just for you.</em>
