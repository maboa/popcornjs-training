		<h1>How would you like your Popcorn?</h1>
		<p>Popcorn is a JavaScript Library (Popcorn.js) and a video editing tool (Popcorn Maker) which makes up part the Mozilla Foundation's Webmaker initiative</p>
		<p>We're going to concentrate on Popcorn.js in this course, but first a brief lowdown on the wider Popcorn thing.</p>
		<p>Popcorn Maker is the second major iteration of creating a web-based video editing tool for the masses. The first was called <a href="http://popcornjs.org/butter-player">Butter Player</a>. However <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/butter/">Butter</a> is actually an SDK for authoring Popcorn projects.</p>
		<p>I think Popcorn Maker is a great tool, it's simple and powerful and newer versions (still in development I believe) are focussing on sequencing or remixing from various sources. Popcorn Maker is built with Popcorn.js and so allows the Popcorn Team to dogfood the core library.</p>
		<p>So to sum up ...
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn.js</strong> is the JavaScript library used chiefly by developers.
				<li>
					<strong>Popcorn Maker</strong> is a visual editor that uses Popcorn.js at its core and is used by anyone.
				<li>
					<strong>Butter Player</strong> is the prequel to Popcorn Maker - now largely defunct.
				<li>
					<strong>Butter</strong> is an SDK for authoring Popcorn projects.
			</ul>
